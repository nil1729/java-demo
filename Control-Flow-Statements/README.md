### Control Flow Statements
- Something that we really need and essential for programming, is to be able to flow and decide where the flow of program is going to go and what code is going to be executed.
- We are going to be learning that in this section. We're going to be dealing with the `switch statement`, the `for statement`, the `while statement`, and the `do-while statement`.

### The for statement 
- ```
    for (init; condition; increment) {
        // statements
    }
  ```
  
### The while Statement
- ```
    while (condition) {
        // statements
    }
  ```
- The `whlile` loop checks the condition at the start before executing the block
### The do-while statement
- ```
    do {
        // statments
    } while (condition);
  ```
- With the `do while` loop the code block is executed at least once and then the condition is checked.

### `break` and `continue` keyword
- We can interrupt the loop by using a `continue` and/or a `break` statement.
- With the `continue` keyword the loop will bypass the part of code block that is below the `continue` keyword and continue with the next iteration.
- With the `break` keyword we can exit the loop depending on the condition that we are checking.

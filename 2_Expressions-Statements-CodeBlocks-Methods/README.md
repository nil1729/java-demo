### If then Else
- The `if` statement identifies which statement or code block to run based on the value of an expression. In other words based on specific condition.
- Inside the code block defined by curly braces `{` and `}` we can have one or multiple statements.
- We can use the `else` statement after the `if`. In that case when the condition is false the else block will be executed.
- We can also add `else if` to test multiple conditions.
- The following is the basic structure of the `if` then `else` statement
- ```
    if (condition) {
        // if statement (block)
    } else {
        // else statment (block)
    }
  ``` 
  
### Method Overloading
- `Method Overloading` is a feature that allows us to have more than one method with the `same name`, so long as we use `different parameters`.
- It is the ability to create multiple methods of the same name with different implementations
- Calls to an overloaded method will run a specific implementation of that method.
- The `println` method is a great example of method overloading in the Java language.
- There are actually 10 methods with the name `println`.
- We can print an integer, double, string and so on ...
- It improves code readability and re-usability.
- It is easier to remember one method name instead of remembering multiple names.
- Achieve consistency in naming. One name for methods that commonly used for example `println`.
- Overloaded methods give programmers the flexibility to call a similar method with different types of data.
